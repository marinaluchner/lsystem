Turtle Trees
========================

A simulator to visualise different organic systems using [L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

You can select different presets, or make your own custom structure!

Running Turtle Trees
=========================

You can download the executable files for your OS (Windows, Mac or Ubuntu) from this repository.
(UPDATE: The Azure theme imported means the most recent executables do not work. We recommend running the core.py file instead)

In Ubuntu you may need to set the file as an executable:

```bash
chmod +x turtletrees_ubuntu
```
Alternatively, you can clone the repository, install the dependencies from requirements.txt and execute the core.py file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 turtletrees/core.py
```
